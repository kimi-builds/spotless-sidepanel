Spotside is a Chrome extension that allows you to control your Spotify player, mute annoying ads, search and play music from the recently implemented SidePanel API. At the moment it's relatively barebones, although functional. Requires a late 2023 Chromium-derived browser. Also, this version has been built already, so you can just clone the repo and unpack it to use it under developer mode.

## Usage
 - This extension only compatible with Spotify web app and desktop app. It also requires you to login to Spotify on web app to be able to use your cookies.

 - You need at least one available device running Spotify (either web app player or desktop app player) to use the extension, which makes sense, you wouldn't be able to listen to music if you don't have any device opening Spotify, the extensions cannot play music itself, it's a controller.

- The Ads mute feature only work if you have a tab opening https://open.spotify.com on your Chrome browser. So the extension can detect whether an ads or a song is playing.

- You can still play music on your Spotify desktop client and mute the ads, as long as you open https://open.spotify.com on a tab of your browser for the extension to work.

 - Controlling mobile device is a feature for Spotify Premium users, this extensions will not work with mobile device.
